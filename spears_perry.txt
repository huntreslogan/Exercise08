I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Baby, oh

"All aboard"
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this...?"
"Yeah, yes it is"
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"
"Oh, you shouldn't have"

Oops!...I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby
Oops!...You think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too.
And I need to do what I feel like doing.
So let me go and just listen.

All you people look at me like I'm a little girl.
Well did you ever think it be okay for me to step into this world.

Always saying little girl don't step into the club.
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why cause dancing's what I love.

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy.
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy.

What's practical is logical. What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there.

I'm a slave for you. I cannot hold it; I cannot control it.
I'm a slave for you. I won't deny it; I'm not trying to hide it.

I really wanna dance, tonight with you.
(I just can't help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to.
(I just feel I let myself go)

I really wanna dance, tonight with you.
(Wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to.
(Uh Uh Uh)

Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me, 
(I just wanna dance next to you) 
To another time and place.
Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me, 
(Are you ready)
Leaving behind my name, my age.

I'm a slave for you. (Take that) I cannot hold it; I cannot control it.
I'm a slave (It just feels right) for you. (It just feels good) 
I won't deny it; I'm not trying to hide it. (Baby)

Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOA)
Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOOOA)
Get it get it, get it get it (OOOHHHH)
(Panting)

Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOA)

Get it get it, get it get it (OOOHHHH)
(Panting)

I cannot hold it; I cannot control it.
I'm a slave for you. (Here we go) I won't deny it, (Yeah)
I'm not trying to hide it.

In love, In no belief
Never found inside of Me
Built these walls up so high
Needed my room to breathe 

Oh Baby, Oh baby
You tear them down
Can't believe you've changed my mind
Oh Baby, Oh Baby
I saw your smile
Stay with me a while 

All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me

With you I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky
You are this melody
That's where you take me 

I never fell before
How did u find my door
The key up to my soul
To you forever more 

Oh baby, Oh baby
You make me rise
And never did I once think twice
Oh Baby, Oh baby
You make me smile
Stay with me a while 

Ooh! 

All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me

With you I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky (crystal skies)
You are this melody
That's where you take me 

Afraid to let it all inside
Now I wanna hear you'll
stay with me a while
stay with me a while 

Baby, can't you see 
I'm calling 
A guy like you 
Should wear a warning 
It's dangerous 
I'm fallin' 

There's no escape 
I can't hide 
I need a hit 
Baby, give me it 
You're dangerous 
I'm lovin' it 

Too high 
Can't come down 
Losing my head 
Spinning 'round and 'round 
Do you feel me now 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

It's getting late 
To give it up 
I took a sip 
From my devil cup 
Slowly 
It's taking over me 

Too high 
Can't come down 
It's in the air 
And it's all around 
Can you feel me now 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

Don't you know that you're toxic 

Taste of my lips and having fun 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

I'm intoxicated now 
I think you'll love it now 
I think I'm ready now 
I think I'm ready now 
I'm intoxicated now 
I think you'll love it now 
I think I'm ready now
